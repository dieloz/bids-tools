## Recommended workflow for converting existing data into a BIDS structure

  - organize the files in the right directory structure
  - convert the DICOM "source" data to nifti
  - convert the EEG/iEEG "source" data files 
  - rename the data files
  - create the sidecar files
  - complete the details in the sidecar files that can be obtained from the data files
    - some details may need to come from the "source" data
  - complete the sidecar files with the knowledge that only the researcher has
